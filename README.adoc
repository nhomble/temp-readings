= temperature readings
[.lead] My final project for the JHU hadoop-class which does a small introduction to some Apache projects in the big data space.

== Setup

[source,shell script]
----
$ cd deploy/
$ docker-compose --env-file .env up -d
$ create-topic SOME_TOPIC
----

Setup your [Kaggle] credentials by downloading kaggle.json with your own credentials.

[source,shell script]
----
$ cd deploy/
$ download-data.sh
$ cat temperature-readings-iot-devices.zip
----

Start publishing 'real time' data to kafka by running

[source,shell script]
----
$ cd deploy/
$ publish.sh SOME_TOPIC
----

Build our topology jar
[source, shell script]
----
$ mvn clean package
$ cp ./path/to/target/jar ./deploy/nimbus/deploy
----

If you are using the deploy/ directory as is, then the docker-compose will
mount deploy/nimbus/deploy to /deploy on the container. So
open a shell in that container

[source, shell script]
----
$ docker exec -it nimbus /bin/bash
----

Once you are in the container, then the last step will be to submit
the topology into storm. To make it easier to script, I just added a run.sh into
that location so that you can just exec in the shell.
[source, shell script]
----
# cd /deploy
# TYPE=temp
# sh run_${TYPE}.sh
----

Finally, you can observe the topology via storm-ui.

To kill a running topology, just open a shell in the nimbus container and run:
[source, shell script]
----
# TOPOLOGY_NAME=temperature
# WAIT_SECONDS=1
# storm kill $TOPOLOGY_NAME -w $WAIT_SECONDS
